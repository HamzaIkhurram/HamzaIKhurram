## Hi, I’m Hamza 👋

🎓 3rd-year Electrical & Software Engineering student at the University of Calgary  
⚙️ Systems-oriented engineer working across software, data pipelines, and hardware abstraction  
📊 Interested in building reliable, production-grade systems—not demos  

I enjoy working at the boundary where **code meets infrastructure**: data pipelines that don’t break, software that scales, and hardware-aware systems that behave predictably.

---

## 🔧 What I’m Working On

- Designing **Python + SQL data pipelines** with clear contracts, validation, and failure handling  
- Building **analytics-ready data models** and Power BI dashboards for real decision-making  
- Applying **software engineering discipline (SDLC, versioning, testing)** to data systems  
- Working with **hardware-adjacent workflows** (SystemVerilog / embedded logic) and understanding how low-level constraints shape software design  

My focus is less on flashy models and more on **correctness, observability, and maintainability**.

## 🧠 Engineering Interests

- Data Engineering & Analytics Platforms  
- Backend & Systems Software  
- Hardware-Software Co-Design  
- Digital Design (SystemVerilog, simulation, verification)  
- Distributed & Cloud-Native Systems  
- Performance, reliability, and failure analysis  

I’m especially interested in **how large systems fail—and how to design them so they don’t**.
